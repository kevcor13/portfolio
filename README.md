## Portfolio Website

This project byitself is pretty self explanitory. This is my 3rd and final Portfolio website that i've built for myself. I started by using html and css for a basic personal website. However, when I built more projects using react and JS I was able to come up with a portfolio website that had more aimaitions, more structure and overall better UI expereince. 

### Frameworks & technicals 

some of the frameworks I used were **Next.js**
I used 2 main langueges **Typescript** for the the structure and the function handling & **CSS** for styling the webpage. 
I also used **Vercel** for webhosting live

## 🚀 Usage

I use this website mostly for showcasing my skills on a personlaized webspage to recruiters and job postings. This project has helped me build web developing skills along with framework handling. 

There is no installations required for this project, simply cliking on the live link hosted by Vercel, everyone with the link can see my Portfolio website.
